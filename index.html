      <h2>Nintendo Ending Support Of Its Wii U And 3DS Eshops</h2>
      <h5>2/16/2022</h5>
      <p>Nintendo's take on digital distribution leaves many confused</p>
      <p>A bunch of Wii U and DS games are unfortunately going to vanish at some point between now and March as Nintendo plans to shut down both the Wii U and 3DS eShops. This means that players will no longer be able to purchase any digital-only games on either system, including several hundred retro titles that are available on virtual consoles. Sony tried to pull a similar stunt in 2021, although quickly reversed its decision after backlash. Only time will tell if Nintendo does the same.</p>

      <h2>Futurama Is Getting A New 20-Episode Series, Will Premiere On Hulu In 2023</h2>
      <h5>2/9/2022</h5>
      <p>But a familiar cast member is no where to be found.. yet</p>
      <p>Animated sci-fi series Futurama will return in 2023 and has most of the original cast and producers in tow. Premiering on Hulu next year, this new series of Futurama will last for 20 episodes and starts production this month. However, one notable absentee is John DiMaggio, the original voice actor of Bender. DiMaggio isn't currently attached to the project, but producers are allegedly looking to get him on board.</p>

      <h2>The PS5 Is Now Selling Slower Than The PS4</h2>
      <h5>2/2/2022</h5>
      <p>Surely this has nothing to do with supply chain issues.</p>
      <p>Another interesting piece of info revealed during Sony's earning call is that sales of the PS5 are slowing down, although not because of lack of demand. Component shortages have meant that Sony hasn't been able to ship as many PS5s as it would've liked, and we're now starting to see the impact of that in terms of sales. Sony has still managed to shift 17.3 million units since launch, but the PS4 shifted 20.2 million in the same timeframe.</p>

      <h2>Halo Infinite has reached 20 Million Players!</h2>
      <h5>1/25/2022</h5>
      <p>Microsofts flagship series is still going strong</p>
      <p>Another exciting announcement today comes from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella who has revealed that Halo Infinite has amassed over 20 million players since launch, making it the biggest launch in the franchise's history. The multiplayer being free-to-play probably helped a lot, as did the game's single player launching on Xbox Game Pass, but it's clear to see that the Halo franchise is finally back on track after a shaky few years.</p>

      <h2>Begun, the acquisition war has</h2>
      <h5>1/19/2022</h5>
      <p>Developers are being snagged up left and right!</p>
      <p>Sony just announced its intent to acquire Destiny maker Bungie for $3.6 billion, capping whatâ€™s been an absolutely massive month for gaming acquisitions. Take-Two kicked things off with its deal to buy Zynga for $12.7 billion, which at the time may have counted as the biggest deal in the video game industry, but Microsoft significantly one-upped that just a week later with its $68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard. The total value of all three acquisitions, assuming they all go through, is a staggering $85 billion.</p>

      <h2>Sony Increases PS4 Production</h2>
      <h5>1/12/2022</h5>
      <p>PS5 Inventory nowhere to be found</p>
      <p>As a result of the global chip shortage, Sony has decided to produce more Playstation 4 consoles as there are not enough semiconducotors available to manufacture PS5 units. This means it will only get harder for people who want a PS5 console but don't have one yet.</p>
