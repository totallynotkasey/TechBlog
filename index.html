      <h2>Begun, the acquisition war has</h2>
      <h5>1/19/2022</h5>
      <p>Developers are being snagged up left and right!</p>
      <p>Sony just announced its intent to acquire Destiny maker Bungie for $3.6 billion, capping whatâ€™s been an absolutely massive month for gaming acquisitions. Take-Two kicked things off with its deal to buy Zynga for $12.7 billion, which at the time may have counted as the biggest deal in the video game industry, but Microsoft significantly one-upped that just a week later with its $68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard. The total value of all three acquisitions, assuming they all go through, is a staggering $85 billion.</p>

      <h2>Sony Increases PS4 Production</h2>
      <h5>1/12/2022</h5>
      <p>PS5 Inventory nowhere to be found</p>
      <p>As a result of the global chip shortage, Sony has decided to produce more Playstation 4 consoles as there are not enough semiconducotors available to manufacture PS5 units. This means it will only get harder for people who want a PS5 console but don't have one yet.</p>
